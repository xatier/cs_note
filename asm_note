======================

the difference between C code and assembly language?

like to teach a baby XD

    mov eax, Y
    add eax, 4
    mov ebx, 3
    imul ebx
    mov X, eax

eax, register, like memorization part in your brain

imul => integer (positive)

asm is difficult to maintain, port to other platforms

virtual machine
    language L0, L1
    intepretation
    translation

std::cout << (A*B +C);

mov eax, A
mul B
add eax, C
call WriteInt

=> to intel machine language

specific machine levels:

    high level language
    assembly language
    operating system
    instruction set architecture (ISA)
    microarchitecture
    hardware (digital logic)

data representation
    binary numbers
    storage size
    signed? unsigned?
    character storage

    
hex!

1 for true and 0 for false
MSB most significant bit
LSB least significant bit

MSB    LSB
10110010
7      0

decimal to binary conversion

tow's complement

char representation

boolean algebra
symbolic logic
operators and truth table


flags
    carry, overflow, sign, zero, auxiliary carry, parity
registers
    e for extented
    hi-bit, lo-bit
    eax ... blah
    eip instruction pointer, porgram counter
floating point uni
    mmx, xmm

8 storage for floating numbers
ST(0) ... ST(7)

base:offset

segmented memory

application => OS functions => BIOS => hardware

ASM can be all levels above!

=====================

integer constants
hdbr
hexadecimal, decimal, binary, encoded real
if a value is starting by zero 0A5h => a number, not a variable

quotes like python, double or single is okay

MASM in appendix A

identifier
    not case sensitive

instructions: label, mnemonic, opeand, comment
[label :] mnemonic operands [;comments]

labels
L1:

jump! goto!

operands
    constant, constant expression => immediate values
    register
    memory (data label)

what is software?
    instructions, data structure, documentation

software doesn't wear out?

spec -> high level design?

get some open source projects (components) from the Internet or get
service from commercial companies

wear vs. deterioration

game software.


different applications, different life (?

3D printer, the next generation style life

5-generation Internet, very high speed

Legacy!

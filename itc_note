information theroy
coding theory
crypotography

like probability but more boring than it Orz

efficiency, error detection/correctoin, secrecy/authentication

use encrypted data instead of encoded data

authenticatoin: to ensure some messages are sent by somebody


Krypto -> hidden, secret
graphy -> writing, study


haffman code: encoding to the frequency of characters

linear coding: take a matrix to do multiplication

use more bits for correction

take encryption as a secure communication channel

cryptology (保密學)

cryptography / cryptanalysis
密碼學/解密學

symmetric-key cryptosystem
asymmetric-key cryptosystem

block cipher (塊狀加密)
AES, DES

stream cipher (串流加密)
RC4

ciphertext (密文)
plaintext (明文)

Three hard math problems

factorization     n = pq
discrete log      q^x = b mod p, find x
closest vector of a lattice

millionaires problem
query data privately
    send an encrypted query regarding stored data
    get a useful concise response

    I'd like search something but I don't like to let server know

attribute based encryption

searchable encryption
    server gains no knowledge about keyword or the file content stored on the cloud storage



learning cryptography by applications?







9/25
=======

classical cryptography

shift cipher
substitution cipher
Affine cipher
Vigenere cipher
Hill cipher
permutation cipher

cryptanalysis

encrypter -> decrypter

take finite set of possible plaintexts, ciphertexts

congruence

try all combinations in the key space

π: permutation

Affine Cipher
    ax == b (mod m)
    phi function: the number of integers in Zm that are relatively prime to m
    relatively prime: 互質
    phi(mn) = phi(m)phi(n) while gcd(m, n) = 1

[phi function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_totient_function)

prime power

phi(26) = phi(2)phi(13) = 1 * 12 = 12


[Vigenere cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenere_cipher)

substitution
permutation


assumption: Kerckhoff's principle
    the opponent knows the cryptosystem being used

ciphertext only attack
known plaintext attack
known plaintext attack
chosen plaintext attack
chosen ciphertext attack


statistical -> english

alphabet / digram / trigram frequency

你有的條件有多少?





9/27
=====
vigenere cipher

Kasaski test (find m only)
Friedman test
    - Ic(x): index of coincidence of x
        the probability that 2 random elements of X are identical


we need to write a program to crack Vigenere cycle


DES



10/2
========
vigenere cipher

if m is correct, will be closed to 0.00625
if m is incorrect, each Ic(Yi) about 1/26 = 0.038
find m


DES
1973-1977
official data encryption
powered by IBM

key space: 2^56  -> AES(2000): 2^128

block size: 64bits

DES is a special type of iterated cipher called a Feistel cipher
左右打亂

round function


permutation

expansion function

initial permutation, inverse initial permutaion

S-box -> it's a non-linear function
    like zap a 6-bit sequence to a 4 bit sequence


breaking DES
Matsui linear attack

double-DES ->
    [meet in the middle attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack)

3-DES
    Ek1(Ek2(Ek3(m)))
    Ek1(Dk2(Ek1(m)))

10/16 cryptography
==================

[descrete log](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) problems

you don't have a easy approach to solve the descrete log problems, so the algorithm is secure.
the factorization problem is hard too.




Elgamal cryptographic system

\alpha -> a generator

\alpha^(q-1) -> 1

z_q* 


random encryption
    - if you encypt it twice, maybe the different output :~
    - but the value of random number doesn't matter decryption
    

group/ring/field

information theroy
coding theory
crypotography

like probability but more boring than it Orz

efficiency, error detection/correctoin, secrecy/authentication

use encrypted data instead of encoded data

authenticatoin: to ensure some messages are sent by somebody


Krypto -> hidden, secret
graphy -> writing, study


haffman code: encoding to the frequency of characters

linear coding: take a matrix to do multiplication

use more bits for correction

take encryption as a secure communication channel

cryptology (保密學)

cryptography / cryptanalysis
密碼學/解密學

symmetric-key cryptosystem
asymmetric-key cryptosystem

block cipher (塊狀加密)
AES, DES

stream cipher (串流加密)
RC4

ciphertext (密文)
plaintext (明文)

Three hard math problems

factorization     n = pq
discrete log      q^x = b mod p, find x
closest vector of a lattice

millionaires problem
query data privately
    send an encrypted query regarding stored data
    get a useful concise response

    I'd like search something but I don't like to let server know

attribute based encryption

searchable encryption
    server gains no knowledge about keyword or the file content stored on the cloud storage



learning cryptography by applications?

history of AI

given a problem and some data, make an algorithm to develop some solution

[Sebastian Thrun: Google's driverless car](http://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_thrun_google_s_driverless_car.html)


standard <-> sensors <-> feedback

- [learning agents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent)

feedback make the system changes
actuators is the part `act`s the model


AI: MIT, Stanford, CMU

article analysis system

given a problem, we build a model to analyze that, and then prediction?

start: modeling the system

classify the sample to different models

modeling human brain: neural network

    different from a `computer`

evolutionary computing

[Genetic algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)

represent the model as a set of gene


feed-forward network: multi-layer structure of our brains

natural language

learning from examples (samples)

1. missionary problem
1. p1 p2 p3

the study of human emotion is the golden goad

common sense reasoning

knowledge representation + operation (or constraint)

coloring problem

good knowledge representation makes the problem easier

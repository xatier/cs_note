Types of Proof
    Proof by construction
        many theorems state that a particular type of object exists
    Proof by contradiction (歸謬)
        assume that the theroem is false, and then show that this assumption leads to
        an obviously false consequence
    Proof by induction
        basis
        hypothesis
        induction step


Regular Langauges
    RL -> DFA -> NFA -> RE

if we can find a DFA that accept all sets in  Language L, that is, L is regular
DFA <-> NFA

Deterministic finite automaton
A DFA representing a regular language can be used either in an accepting mode to validate that
an input string is part of the language, or in a generating mode to generate a list of all the
strings in the language.


Finite automata

state transision table
state diagram

a deterministic finite automation is a 5-tuple (Q, sigma, delta, q0, F)
    Q : a finite set called the states
    Σ : a finite set called the alphabet
    δ : Qxsigma -> Q is the transition function, exactily one resultant state
    q0 in Q: is the start state
    F in Q: is the set of accept states (final states)


L(M) = A
M recognizes A (M accepts A)
A is the set of all strings that M accepts



please show your proof clearly!

=====
deterministric <-> non-deterministric

start state will get the first alphabet of input stream

delta (transision function) can be reprecented as a table
last if the state is F (final state), then the machine accepts the input stream


M = (Q, sigma, delta, q0, F)
w: a string over sigma, wi in sigma

M accepts w if a sequence of states r0, r1, ..., rn exists in Q and satisfies the following 3 conditions:
    r0 = q0
    delta(ri, wi+1) = ri+1, for i = 0..n-1
    rn in F


M recognizes language A if A = {w| M accepts w}

definition: a language is called a regular language if some DFA recognize it (one or more)

so, if we can construct a DFA that accepts L, then we can proof L is regular

Q: how can we proof if L is not regular?

[pumping lemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma_for_regular_languages)


DFA: only can memorize states (limited memory)


regular operations

A, B: language
Union, concatenation, star
A U B = {x | x in A or x in B}
A . B = {xy | x in A and y in B}
A* = {x1x2x3...xk | k >= 0 and each xi in A}   # A concatenate A


The class of regular languages is closed under the union operation

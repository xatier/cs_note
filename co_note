performance

measure, report, and summarize
response time (latency per job)
throuphput (system performance)
    單位時間能跑的 job 個數

Elapsed time
    counts everything (useful number, but oftern not good for comparison purposes)
CPU time
    doesn't count I/O and other programs
    sustem time / user time
our focus: user CPU time
    time spent executing in our program
Performance
    performance = 1 / execution time


cycle time
Law of Performance
CPI (cycle per instruction)
MIPS
MFLOPS
SPECCmarks
Benchmarks
Averageing

CPU clocking
operation of digital hardware governed by a constant-rate clock

clock frequency
clock period

cputime = time / program
        = (instruction/program) * (cycles/instruction) * (time/cycle)


cycletime: time/cycle
instruction per program
    ISA and compiler
CPI
    ISA and architecture
time per cycletime -> time between ticks
    organization, hardware, technology, layout

[intel tick-tock model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Tick-Tock)


performance depends on
    algorithm: IC (instruction count), possibly CPI
    programming language: IC, CPI
    compiler: IC, CPI
    ISA: IC, CPI, Tc


MIPS million instruction per second

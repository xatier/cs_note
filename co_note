performance

measure, report, and summarize
response time (latency per job)
throuphput (system performance)
    單位時間能跑的 job 個數

Elapsed time
    counts everything (useful number, but oftern not good for comparison purposes)
CPU time
    doesn't count I/O and other programs
    sustem time / user time
our focus: user CPU time
    time spent executing in our program
Performance
    performance = 1 / execution time


cycle time
Law of Performance
CPI (cycle per instruction)
MIPS
MFLOPS
SPECCmarks
Benchmarks
Averageing

CPU clocking
operation of digital hardware governed by a constant-rate clock

clock frequency
clock period

cputime = time / program
        = (instruction/program) * (cycles/instruction) * (time/cycle)


cycletime: time/cycle
instruction per program
    ISA and compiler
CPI
    ISA and architecture
time per cycletime -> time between ticks
    organization, hardware, technology, layout

[intel tick-tock model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Tick-Tock)


performance depends on
    algorithm: IC (instruction count), possibly CPI
    programming language: IC, CPI
    compiler: IC, CPI
    ISA: IC, CPI, Tc


MIPS million instruction per second

========

MIPS

(instruction / program) * (program / time) x 10^-6

= (inst count / (exec time * 10^-6))
= clock rate / CPI * 10^-6

meaningless indicator of performance


Ex. two compilers
cpu cycles
Class A: 1
Class B: 2
Class C: 3

compiler 1: 5M class A, 1M class B, 1M class C
compiler 2: 10M class A, 1M class B, 1M class C

CPI1 = (5*1 + 1*2 + 1 * 3)/(5+1+1)

MFlops: mega flops (floating point operation)


Benchmarks
Performance best determined by running a real application
small benchmarks
spec (system performance evaluation cooperative)

arithmetic mean
    means for times, CPI
harmonic mean
    means for rates, MIPS, MFLOPS
geometric mean
    normalize numbers


算幾不等式...

(a+b)/2  >   sqrt(ab)   >    2/(1/a + 1/b)

算數平均會比較樂觀

SPARC10


Amdahl's Law

execution time after improvement =
execution time unaffected + (execution time affected / amount of improvement)

Principle: Make the common case fast

improvement to be gained from using faster mode is limited buy the fraction of the time the faster mode can be used


power if the first class design issue

manufacturing IC

=====
slt
set on less then

result = 1 when (a < b)
the last bit + a lot of 0

actually, it's a subtraction

EQ: a-b = 0, implies a = b


improve adder by carry lookahead
ripple carry adder is slow

when generate carry? gi = ai & bi
when propagate the carry? pi = ai | bi

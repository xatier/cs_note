DE is very important because we can predict the next state even if the observation time duration is very short

you don't need to come up with the whole system equation, allow you to simplitfy the problem

* modeling

normal form if not useful

we have to break equations down to some special forms we can recognize


classification of DE by linearity

f(x)
f(ax + by) = af(x) + bf(y)  <- linearity

tools for prediction

linear problems are easier to solve
and you can figure out the final answer with a combination of each sub problems

solution curve

explicit and implicit solutions

explicit sol: A solution in which the dependent variable is expressed solely in terms of the independent variable and constants is called an explicit solution

implicit sol: A relation G(x, y) = 0 is said to be an implicit solution of an ODE on an interval I provided there exists at least one function y that satisfies the relation was well as the differential equation on I


usually, implicit solutions are good enough

verification: just put variables into terms inside the equations



families of solutions

A solution to a 1st-order DE containing an arbitrary constant represents a set G(x, y, c) = 0 of solution if called a one-parameter family of solutions

For nth-order DE, an n-parameter family of solutions can be presented as G(x, y, c1, c3, ..., cn) = 0
If the parameters c1, c2, ..., cn are resolved, then it's called a particular solution of DE


tech: piecewise solutions


this particular solution cannot be obtained by a single choice of c


Singular solution
A singular solution is a solution that connot be obtained by specializing any of the parameters in the family of solutions


General solutions



trivial solution and singular solutoin are not the same thing

initial value problem

first/second order IVP


solution by direct integration
just integrate both sides

connecting all the slopes -> get the curve (approximately)

"visualize" the solution curve

lineal element

slope field

the collection of the lineal elements on a rectangular grid on the xy-plane is called a direction field or a slpoe field of the DE dy/dx = f(x,y)


uniqueness of IVP solutions

XXX: a family: different constant C?

IVP: you have to set some initial conditions


existence and uniqueness theorem

y = y0 + integral(x0 to x) f(x, y) dx

# note: this must pass through x0, y0

y = y0 + integral(x0 to x) f(t, y) dt

# change x to dummy variable t

dy/dx = f(x, y), y(x0) = y0

First Order Differential Equations


Separable Equations

dy/dx = g(x) h(y) = g(x) / f(y), where f(y) = 1 / h(y)

  -> like: P(x, y) = P(x) P(y) while x and y are independent


we want f(y) = 1 / h(y) because sometimes we can have terms including ln(x) and e(x) to make them disappeared


divide the equation above by h(y)

f(y) dy / dx = g(x)

note: you have to check the case where h(y) = 0, the divisors could be zero in some cases


we can apply log properties to something like (ln x + ln y to ln xy) or (ln x - ln y to ln x/y)

some mathematical models about differential equations

linear first order DE

homogeneous / non-homogeneous

standard form

dy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x)

integrating factors

the solution will come with two parts y = yc + yp

yc is a vector space, yp is a normal vector for a offset from the original point

variation of parameters

general solution

we have to transform the equations to some special forms before using these fancy skills

particular solution

standard form

integration by parts

  int( u dv ) = uv - int(vdu)

dy/dx = P(x) y = Q(x)

Q(x) <- internal characteristics



solution by substitutions

y = Beta(x, v), where v is a sub-function of f(x, y)

so the key point is, how to construct the Beta function that can simplify the calculus to some very simple forms

common cases of solution by substitution

  - part of the DE has the form f(ax + by + c)
  - the DE has homogeneous equation form
  - Bernoulli equations


homogeneous equation: if f(tx, ty) = t^a f(x, y) for some real number a, then f is a homogeneous equation of degree a

M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0

Bernoulli's Equation:

v = y^(1-n)

dv/dx = (1-n) y^(-n) dy/dx

high order equations

second order linear equations

G(x, y(x), y'(x), y''(x)), where for each x belongs to I where I is the open interval of definition

A(x)y'' + B(x)y' + C(x)y = F(x)

assume A(x), B(x), C(x), and F(x) are continuous on the open interval I

2nd order approximations are usually good enough


start at rest : initial conditions are zero

span: all possible linear combinations

IVP: y = c1y1(x) + c2y2(x)  # that is a linear combination


find the determinant of a matrix


y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = 0

y1 and y2 are linearly independent?

    if so:  W(y1, y2) != 0 at each point of I -> y = c1y1(X) + c2y2(x) would be a general solutoin
    if not: W(y1, y2) == 0 on I



the 2nd order DE can be extended as a nth order DE (general case)

all the properties can also be applied to nth order DE

In mathematics, an analytic function is a function that is locally given by a convergent power series. There exist both real analytic functions and complex analytic functions, categories that are similar in some ways, but different in others.

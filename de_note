DE is very important because we can predict the next state even if the observation time duration is very short

you don't need to come up with the whole system equation, allow you to simplitfy the problem

* modeling

normal form if not useful

we have to break equations down to some special forms we can recognize


classification of DE by linearity

f(x)
f(ax + by) = af(x) + bf(y)  <- linearity

tools for prediction

linear problems are easier to solve
and you can figure out the final answer with a combination of each sub problems

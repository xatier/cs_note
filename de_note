====

DE is very important because we can predict the next state even if the observation time duration is very short

you don't need to come up with the whole system equation, allow you to simplitfy the problem

* modeling

normal form if not useful

we have to break equations down to some special forms we can recognize


classification of DE by linearity

f(x)
f(ax + by) = af(x) + bf(y)  <- linearity

tools for prediction

linear problems are easier to solve
and you can figure out the final answer with a combination of each sub problems

solution curve

explicit and implicit solutions

explicit sol: A solution in which the dependent variable is expressed solely in terms of the independent variable and constants is called an explicit solution

implicit sol: A relation G(x, y) = 0 is said to be an implicit solution of an ODE on an interval I provided there exists at least one function y that satisfies the relation was well as the differential equation on I


usually, implicit solutions are good enough

verification: just put variables into terms inside the equations



families of solutions

A solution to a 1st-order DE containing an arbitrary constant represents a set G(x, y, c) = 0 of solution if called a one-parameter family of solutions

For nth-order DE, an n-parameter family of solutions can be presented as G(x, y, c1, c3, ..., cn) = 0
If the parameters c1, c2, ..., cn are resolved, then it's called a particular solution of DE


tech: piecewise solutions


this particular solution cannot be obtained by a single choice of c


Singular solution
A singular solution is a solution that connot be obtained by specializing any of the parameters in the family of solutions


General solutions



trivial solution and singular solutoin are not the same thing

initial value problem

first/second order IVP


solution by direct integration
just integrate both sides

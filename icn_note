    history

mail server 表示悲劇...

virtual circuit

霸氣四射w

ethernet collision

botnet
security

in cellphone system: base station (SB)
wifi- AP (access point)


電話交換機裡面有在跑程式啊QQ
client server 講反惹....Orz

asscess to the net

DSL (digital subscribe line)
DSL modem/telephone => splitter
    ADSL, A for Asymmetric (different upload and download rate)
    撥接 max 56Kbps
    DSLAM: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line_access_multiplexer

    use existing telephone line to central office DSLAM
        data => internet
        voice => telephone net

    FDM: Frequency division multiplexing
        download often use higher frequency => higher speed rate

FTTH: fiber to the home 光纖到你家w

coax 同軸電纜
HFC: hybird fiber coax
    network of cabel, fiber attaches home to ISP router
    光纖拉到社區箱子，然後箱子到家裡用 coax


CMTS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_modem_termination_system
is used to provide high speed data servies such as cable Internet or VoIP to cable subbscribers

NAT
    source 會換成 private 的，出去的時候 NAT 會把 source 換成自己的對外 public IP
    NAT 會紀錄出去的封包的 source IP (private) ，server 回封包時會把進來封包的 destination 換成 pirvate 的 IP

switch 是用 MAC address (layer 2 in ISO model)
router 是用 IP  address (layer 3 in ISO model)

wiredless access networks
    shared wireless access network connects end system to router

其實現在已經有 802.11n 和  a 了XD
wLANs / wide-area wiredless access

cellular 蜂巢式網路 (telco)

        satellite 衛星
             270 minisecond end-end delay
             geosynchronous (同步衛星)

    packet-switching
        hosts break application-layer messages into packets
    forward packets from one router to next, across links on path from src to dst
    each packet transmitted at full link capacity

    store and forward
        buffer 中接收到完整的 packet 後才 forward
        entire packet must arrive at router befor it can be transmitted on next link
    take L/R seconds to transmit L-bit packet into link at R bps
    end-end delay = sum (L_i/R_i)　+ ...
    
    queuing and loss
        後進來的 packet 會 queue 起來，等前面的 packet 先送出去
        queue 滿了就 drop ^q^

    routing
        determines src-dst route taken by packets
        forwarding
            from input port to output port
        source routing

    circuit switching
        先 allocate 好 end-end 完整 routing 的資源
        reserved for 'call'
        circuit segment idle if not used by call (no sharing)
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching
    Newer mobile phone technologies (e.g., GPRS, I-mode) also use packet switching.

期中筆記

protocols define format, order of msgs sent and received
among network entities, and actions taken on msg transmission, receipt

 network edge:
     hosts:clients and servers
     servers often in data centers

 access networks, physical media:
    wired, wireless communication links
    連外的部份

 access ISPs (Internet Service Providers)


network core:
    interconnected routers
    network of networks


transmission delay = L/R 
    packet length / transmission brate

guided media
    signals propagate in solid
    # unguided -> 無線 (radio)


packet-switching: hosts break application-layer messages into packets
    forward packets from one router to the next
    across links on path from source to destination
    each packet transmitted at full link capacity

store and forward:
    entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link
    end-end delay = 2L/R 

queuing and loss:
    packets will queue, wait to be transmitted on link
    packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) fills up
    packet arriving to full queue dropped

routing: determines source- destination route taken by packets
forwarding: move packets from router’s input to appropriate router output

circuit switching: (no sharing) resources allocated to, reserved for “call” between source & dest


FDM: 切頻率給不同的 channel (different users use different channels)
TDM: 切時間片給不同的 user

packet switching allows more users to use network


dnodal = dproc + dqueue + dtrans + dprop
dtrans = L/R
    L: packet length (bits)
    R: link bandwidth (bps)
dprop = d/s
    d: length of physical link
    s: propagation speed in medium (~2x10^8 m/sec)
dqueue: aL/R
    R: link bandwidth (bps)
    L: packet length (bits)
    a: average packet arrival rate

throughput: rate (bits/time unit) at which bits transferred between sender/receiver
    instantaneous: rate at given point in time
    average: rate over longer period of time
    bit/sec


layers: each layer implements services

HTTP is "stateless"

persistent HTTP
    single connection

non-persistent HTTP response time = 2RTT+ file transmission time

If-modified-since:
     <date>
HTTP/1.0 304 Not
     Modified

FTP: out of band

IMAP: keeps user state across sessions:
POP3: download and delete/keep
POP3 is stateless across sessions

File distribution time: client-server
Dc-s > max{NF/us,,F/dmin}
N: file copies
F: File size
us: upload speed
time to send one copy: F/us
Ncopies -> NF/us
dmin = min {d1, d2, ..., dN}  # download speed min


p2p
server transmission: must upload at least one copy
time to send one copy: F/us
min client download time: F/dmin


every 30 secs: randomly select another peer, starts sending chunks
"optimistically unchoke" this peer
newly chosen peer may join top 4



4/22
=========
TCP server

UDP
    best effort
    no frills, bare bones
    out of order
    every segment are independent

checksum

reliable data transfer protocol
    rdt



4/25
========

reliable service

sender/receiver

FSM

ack/nak (negative ack)

explicitly tell packet errer

    -> retransmit

rdt 2.0

every packet transmit as a FSM

2.0 has a fatal flaw
    -> no ACK/NAK (???
    -> or duplicate ACK

timeout
seq number

stop and wait


rdt 2.1

S: 4 states
C: 2 states

rdt 3.0
timeout

packets maybe lost




4/29
===========
pipelined protocols
Go-back-N
    sender can have up to N unacked packets in pipeline
    receiver only sends cumulative ack (get ack 4 means ack 1~4)
    sender has timer for oldest unacked packet
        timeout -> retransmit all unacked packet

selective repeat
    sender can have up to N unacked packeets in pipeline
    receiver sends individual ack for each packet
    sender maintains timer for each unacked packet

Go-back-N
    k-bit seq number in packet header (k-bit to represente N)
    window size N = not yet acked + not yet send
    may receiver duplicate ACKs (sender will ignore it)

extended FSM (?)

out of order pkt
    discard no receiver buggering
    re-ACK pkt with highest in-order seq number


5/2
=======
go back N 只需要一個 timer

duplicate ACK

selective repeat want to improve go-back-N

receiver individual ack all correctly received packets
    buffers packets as need -> in-order

sender only resends packets for which ACK not received
    sender timer for each unACKed packet

sender window
    N consecutive seq number
    limits seq number


5/9
=========
windows size (and sequence number)

     longer than RTT

TCP reliable control

tast retransmit
    3- duplicate ACK

    3-way handshaking

    
5/16
=========

throughout
goodput
    goodput is the application level throughput
    the number of useful information bits
    delivered by the network to a certain destination, per unit of time.
    The amount of data considered excludes protocol overhead bits as well as
    retransmitted data packets.
    This is related to the amount of time from the first bit of the first packet 
    is sent (or delivered) until the last bit of the last packet is delivered, 

end-end congestion dontrol
    timeout
    no explicit feedback from network
    inferred from timeout/triple duplicate ACK


network-assisted congestion control
    single bit indicating congestion (SNA, DECbit, TCP/IP ECN, ATM)
    explicit rate for sender to send

ABR
    available bit rate
RM
    resource management

TCP congestion control
    additive increase (?)
    multiplicative derease

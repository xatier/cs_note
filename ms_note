各種腳位

access approach (from stack)

sp++ / sp--
data_holder


hi/lo, data pointer
flags
psw CPU status flags
    carry, auxilixary carry ...

需要作 combo 的話就需要 accumulator

programming context

general purpose registers in 4 banks
bit map
user's space
special function registers

TMR (timer)

multi-51 system operations master/slave

first fetch, decode, second fetch, third fetch

jump commands
    target addr - PC
    long jump
    absolute jump
    short jump    opcode + relative address


conditional jump


ACall

deep nested call
